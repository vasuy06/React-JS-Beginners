React Features
JSX − JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. It isn’t necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended. With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { } including variables, functions, and properties.
Unidirectional data flow − React implements a one-way data flow. In React, data values are passed to each component as properties in its HTML tags. The component cannot directly modify any properties but can pass a callback function and with the help of this, it can modify the data.
